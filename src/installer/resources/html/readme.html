<h3 style="text-align: center;">Installation Notes</h3>

<p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>

<p>Please make sure that the Open-Xchange backend process is not running during
the installation. The installer will try to stop the server before copying any 
files but it is preferable to have previously stopped it manually.</p>

<p>Also make sure taht there is a full backup of the Open-Xchange backend installation
directory just in case something goes wrong during the installation.</p>

<p>The installer will not try to start the Open-Xchange backend process after the
installation. You must start it manually once the needed configuration tasks have been
executed.</p>

<p><b>Configuration</b></p>

<p>Please remember to review the configuration properties that the component needs
to function correctly and that are stored in a file called <code>latch.properties</code>
in the <code>etc</code> folder of the Open-Xchange backend installation directory.

<p>In that file you can configure your Latch application id and secret as well as
several other options regarding the repository where the pairing information will
be stored</p> 

<p>Also remember that it may be necessary to add the CA that signs the Latch backend
TLS certificates (StartCom Certification Authority) to the JVM certificate truststore
as not all JVMs include it by default.</p>

<p>For debugging purpouses a new logger and file appender can be configured in
<code>logback.xml</code>. For example, to write all component's log messages to its own
log file you can add the following:</p>

<pre><code>

[ . . . ]

&lt;appender name="LATCH" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender"&gt;
    &lt;file&gt;/var/log/open-xchange/open-xchange-latch.log.0&lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;rollingPolicy class="com.openexchange.logback.extensions.FixedWindowRollingPolicy"&gt;
        &lt;fileNamePattern&gt;/var/log/open-xchange/open-xchange-latch.log.%i&lt;/fileNamePattern&gt;
        &lt;minIndex&gt;1&lt;/minIndex&gt;
        &lt;maxIndex&gt;99&lt;/maxIndex&gt;
    &lt;/rollingPolicy&gt;
    &lt;triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy"&gt;
        &lt;maxFileSize&gt;2MB&lt;/maxFileSize&gt;
    &lt;/triggeringPolicy&gt;
    &lt;encoder class="com.openexchange.logback.extensions.ExtendedPatternLayoutEncoder"&gt;
        &lt;pattern&gt;%date{"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss,SSSZ"} [%thread] %level %logger - %message%n%exception{short}&lt;/pattern&gt;
    &lt;/encoder&gt;
&lt;/appender&gt;

[ . . . ]

&lt;logger name="com.elevenpaths.latch" level="ERROR"&gt;
    &lt;appender-ref ref="LATCH" /&gt;
&lt;/logger&gt;

<p><b>Uninstalling</b></p>

<p>If you need to uninstall this component please remember that the installer will generate
an uninstaller named <code>uninstall.jar</code> in a folder named <code>uninstaller</code>
in the installation directory.</p>

<p>Make sure that the Open-Xchange backend process is not running during the uninstall. The
uninstaller will try to stop the server before deleting any files but it is preferable to have
previously stopped it manually.</p>

<p>Please also take into account that the uninstaller will not try to start the Open-Xchange
backend process once the uninstall has finished. You must start the server manually.</p>
